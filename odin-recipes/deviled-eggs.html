		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>6</strong> large eggs</li>
			<li><strong>3 ounces</strong> prepared Mexican street corn dip</li>
			<li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> mayonnaise</li>
			<li><strong>2 teaspoons </strong> freshly squeezed lime juice, or to taste</li>
			<li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> crumbled cotija cheese, divided</li>
			<li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> slivered red onion</li>
			<li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> chopped cilantro</li>
			<li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> chili-lime seasoning, such as Tajin® Clásico Seasoning</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Cut eggs in half lengthwise.</li>
			<li>Remove yolks to a small mixing bowl; mash with a fork. Add in Mexican street corn dip, mayonnaise, and lime juice. Stir together with a fork until fairly smooth; stir in 2 teaspoons of cotija cheese.</li>
			<li>Fit a piping bag with a coupler and a tip with a fairly large opening. Drop piping bag into a tall glass and fold edges down around the glass. Spoon egg yolk filling into the bag. Gather edges and twist together. Pipe filling into egg whites. Alternately, spoon filling into a resealable plastic bag, press to remove excess air, and reseal. Cut one corner of bag off, and pipe filling into egg whites. Or, simply spoon filling into egg whites.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle remaining cotija cheese over eggs; scatter on onion slivers and cilantro. Sprinkle with Tajin® seasoning and serve.</li>
